Error: unknown operation: AF7_Chrysomya-rufifacies_S2_R_kmer_counts.kmc_suf
transform operation transforms single input database to output (text file or KMC database)
General syntax:
kmc_tools transform <input> [input_params] <oper1 [oper_params1] output1 [output_params1]> [<oper2 [oper_params2] output2 [output_params2]>...]
input - path to database generated by KMC 
oper1, oper2, ..., operN          - transform operation name
output1, output2, ..., outputN    - paths to output
 Available operations:
  sort                       - converts database produced by KMC2.x to KMC1.x database format (which contains k-mers in sorted order)
  reduce                     - exclude too rare and too frequent k-mers
  compact                    - remove counters of k-mers
  histogram                  - produce histogram of k-mers occurrences
  dump                       - produce text dump of kmc database
  set_counts <value>         - set all k-mer counts to specific value
 For input there are additional parameters:
  -ci<value> - exclude k-mers occurring less than <value> times 
  -cx<value> - exclude k-mers occurring more of than <value> times
 For sort and reduce operations there are additional output_params:
  -ci<value> - exclude k-mers occurring less than <value> times 
  -cx<value> - exclude k-mers occurring more of than <value> times
  -cs<value> - maximal value of a counter
 For compact, reduce, set_counts and sort operations is an additional output_params:
  -o<kmc|kff> - output in KMC or KFF format (default: kmc) 
 For histogram operation there are additional output_params:
  -ci<value> - minimum value of counter to be stored in the otput file
  -cx<value> - maximum value of counter to be stored in the otput file
 For dump operation there are additional oper_params:
  -s - sorted output
Example:
kmc_tools transform db reduce err_kmers -cx10 reduce valid_kmers -ci11 histogram histo.txt dump dump.txt
